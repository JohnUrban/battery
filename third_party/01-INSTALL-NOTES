NEED IN ENV FOR INSTALL AND RUNNING:
- gcc/g++
- Boost (I've had success with v1.55.0)
- cmake ("" 3.10.1)
- zlib ("" 1.2.11)
- hdf5
- python
- perl
- R
- git
- java ("" 8u66, 8u111)
- readlink on Linux (s.t. readlink -f gives absolute path of a file)
- greadlink on MacOS (s.t. greadlink -f gives absolute path of a file)

You will typically need the same versions in the ENV for running that you used to install.
I've provided a copy of boost here just in case, but it will not be part of the normal INSTALL.


- Bamtools everywhere -- many programs include their own copy (similar with SAMtools)
	- BAMtools is provided stand-alone for Augustus
	- FRC has its own BAMtools
	- REAPR has its own BAMtools
	- Sniffles has its own BAMtools
	- BEDtools has its own BAMtools
	- FreeBayes has its own BAMtools (if I end up including this program in future analyses)
