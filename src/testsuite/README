To populate directories with assemblies and simulated data - as well as creat evals dir, do:
$ bash generate.sh

After running this, cd into "evals/" and do:
$ bash run-evalwrapper.sh input.fofn

Or wait until assemblies are done to do:
$ bash run-evalwrapper.sh input.extended.fofn

#NOTE: assemblies will only run if you are on SLURM and have sbatch....

#NOTE: you may have to modify paths in run-evalwrapper.sh if you are not JohnUrban on Oscar.

To reset, do:
$ bash reset.sh
