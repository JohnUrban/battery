1. eval-da-shit-outta-dis.sh
The original -- just need to populate wd with a subdir called asms with the asm fastas (.fasta)
In wd, do: bash eval-da-shit-outta-dis.sh

2. eval-da-shit-outta-dis.fofn.sh
Made this more recently to be more similar to other automated scripts in slurmgear with while loop and input.fofn instead of asms subdir.
Just need input.fofn in wd pointing to assemblies anywhere. Run by: bash eval-da-shit-outta-dis.fofn.sh

3. shortread-run.sh and scripts/auto-shortreadeval.sh
Made this even more recently to more closely mimic others by separating the while loop fron the "setting up" file.
Note: I have been considering just merging config files with the run files.
--> That way the config file would have all "setting up" and just have the "run" cmd at the bottom.
Need input.fofn in wd.
Run by: bash shortread-run.sh
