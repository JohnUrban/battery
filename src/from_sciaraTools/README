The tools in this directory are from another github repo I have:
	- https://github.com/JohnUrban/sciara-project-tools

I copied them here on Oct 18, 2018 - to package them with Battery so it is self-sufficient.
However, any further development of these tools will not occur here.
Further development of these tools will occur in SciaraTools unless otherwise noted there.
Updates will be copied here as needed.



EXCEPT FOR (AT THE MOMENT):
prepare_bng_or_nabsys_for_maligner.sh
example_map_data/



## I INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING WITH BATTERY AS I CAN INSTRUCT USERS HOW TO PROVIDE MAP DATA FROM BOTH SOURCES
		# UNLIKELY BUT I COULD ALSO ADD CONVERSION TO THE BEGINNING OF THE PIPELINE
bnx2maligner.py
nabsys2maligner.py
